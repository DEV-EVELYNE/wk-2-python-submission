# List Operations Assignment

## Description
This Python script demonstrates basic list operations:
- Creating an empty list
- Adding elements with `append()`
- Inserting an element at a specific position with `insert()`
- Extending the list with another list using `extend()`
- Removing the last element with `pop()`
- Sorting the list in ascending order using `sort()`
- Finding the index of a specific value with `index()`

## Output
When run, the program displays:
- The updated list after all operations
- The index of the value 30 in the final list
